## The project

Together with my buddy [Sjors Lockhorst](https://blog.lockhorst.dev/) I've built an AI powered search engine for artworks. You can simply describe what you want to see (or write anything you want essentially) and it will find the ten closest matching images! We've implemented this for more than half a million artworks that we got from the Amsterdam Rijksmuseum.

We've written a blogpost explaining how we did it and what we had to solve to finish the project. You can find the blogpost here: [Art Explorer Blog Post](https://blog.lockhorst.dev/projects/art-search).

The code is also open source so if you want to take a look, you can find it on [Github](https://github.com/SjorsLockhorst/sem-art-search).
