# About me

I'm a full stack enthousiast currently working as a founding engineer at [NjiaPay](https://www.njiapay.com/) and doing freelance work under [Studio Terabyte](https://studioterabyte.nl/).

I use 🐍 Python and 💻 Typescript professionally and have a personal interest in 🦀 Rust.

Some projects that I've finished are:

- An alternative frontend for Hacker News → [Modern Orange](https://modernorange.io/)
- A web app which helps you save, organize and plan you favorite recipes → [EatFeed](https://eatfeed.app/)
- A website which shows you a random piece of art from the Amsterdam Rijks Museum → [Random Rijks](https://randomrijks.com/)

And some ideas I'm currently working on:

- A semantic search using NLP for art
- A multiplayer game for the terminal
